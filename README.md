# Final-Project
import java.util.Scanner;

this project is a decision tree for choosing a book. It starts by decciding between fiction and non-fiction, then you move through the different routes you can take to get a book recommendation. There are 17 different book options, with 17 different genres. 

The decision part of the project happens in a separate class called "picking." It is primarily compposed of nested if/else statements. There are 5 arrays that the if statement pull from at the decision forks. when a book recommendation is reached the title, author and genre are pulled from the library array in the library class.
